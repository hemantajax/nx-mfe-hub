# Code Style

## General Principles

- Keep code **optimal and minimal** — avoid unnecessary abstractions, wrappers, or boilerplate
- Prefer **early returns** to reduce nesting
- Avoid redundant comments that narrate what the code does; comment only non-obvious intent or trade-offs

## TypeScript Conventions

- Mark properties that should not be reassigned as `readonly`
- Use `protected` for component members accessed only from the template
- Use `private` for truly internal members not used in templates
- Prefer `const` over `let`; never use `var`
- Use strict typing — avoid `any`; prefer `unknown` when the type is genuinely uncertain
- Use optional chaining (`?.`) and nullish coalescing (`??`) over manual null checks

## Functions & Methods

- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility
- Prefer pure functions where possible
- Use arrow functions for callbacks and inline handlers

## Imports

- Use path aliases defined in `tsconfig` for cross-project imports
- Avoid deep relative imports (`../../../`) — restructure or use aliases instead
