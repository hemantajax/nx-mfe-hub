# Nx Monorepo Conventions

## Workspace Structure

- This is an **Nx 22.5** workspace — there is no root `angular.json`
- Each project has its own `project.json` for targets and configuration
- Use `nx.json` for workspace-wide defaults, caching, and task pipeline configuration

## Scaffolding

- Use **Nx generators** to create apps and libraries:
  - `nx g @nx/angular:app` for applications
  - `nx g @nx/angular:lib` for libraries
  - `nx g @nx/angular:component` for components
- Do not manually create project boilerplate; generators ensure consistency

## Library Boundaries

- Tag projects in `project.json` using `tags` for enforcement
- Respect module boundary rules defined in ESLint (`@nx/enforce-module-boundaries`)
- Organize libraries by type: `feature`, `ui`, `data-access`, `util`, `shared`

## Running Tasks

- Use `nx serve <app>` to serve applications
- Use `nx build <app>` for production builds
- Use `nx test <project>` / `nx lint <project>` for testing and linting
- Use `nx affected` to only run tasks on changed projects

## Nx MCP Server

- The Nx MCP server tools are available in this workspace for querying project graphs, generators, and documentation
